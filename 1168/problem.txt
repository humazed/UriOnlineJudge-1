John wants to set up a panel containing different numbers of
LEDs. He does not have many leds, he is not sure if will be
able to mount the desired number. Considering the configuration
of the LEDs of the numbers below, make an algorithm that helps
John to discover the number of LEDs needed to set the value.

    |   _|  _|  |_|  |_   |_    |  |_|  |_|  | |
    |  |_   _|    |   _|  |_|   |  |_|   _|  |_|

Input

The input contains an integer N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 2000) corresponding
to the number of test cases, followed by N lines, each line
containing an number (1 ≤ V ≤ 10100) corresponding to the
value that John wants to set with the leds.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing the number of
LEDs that John needs to set the desired value, followed by
the word "leds".
