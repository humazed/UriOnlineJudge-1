The mean of three integers A, B and C is (A + B + C)/3. The median of three
integers is the one that would be in the middle if they are sorted in
non-decreasing order. Given two integers A and B, return the minimum possible
integer C such that the mean and the median of A, B and C are equal.

Input

Each test case is given in a single line that contains two integers A and B
(1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10^9). The last test case is followed by a line containing two
zeros.

Output

For each test case output one line containing the minimum possible integer C
such that the mean and the median of A, B and C are equal.
