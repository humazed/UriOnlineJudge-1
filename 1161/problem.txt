Read two numbers M and N indefinitely. Calculate and write
the sum of their factorial. Be carefull, because the result
can have more than 15 digits.

Input

The input file contains many test cases. Each test case contains two
integer numbers M (0 ≤ M ≤ 20) and N (0 ≤ N ≤ 20). The end of file
is determined by eof.

Output

For each test case in the input your program must print a single line,
containing an number that is the sum of the both factorial (M and N).
